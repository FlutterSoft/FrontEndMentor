## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Had issues with border-radius not applying to both divs inside a section, need to look into it. It wouldn't apply the border-radius to the div with an image background so I had to manually apply each corner radius to the inside divs. 

### Continued development

In future projects I will stick with a more responsive css layout. I used pixels to match the preview image but it caused more work when creating mobile layout. I should also work mobile first.
