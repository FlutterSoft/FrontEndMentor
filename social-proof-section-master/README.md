### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://fe-mentor-social-proof.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Grid template area is very helpful when needing to move around different sections in the layout depending on what device it is displayed on. 


### Continued development

I had issues with forgetting which elements already had properties like margin and padding on them, so when I started working on the desktop site after completing the mobile view, I had to reset a lot of margins and paddings and widths. This is not ideal and I will work on a way to do this better in the future.
