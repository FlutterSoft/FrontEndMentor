## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The main issue with this build was the overlayed colour on the image. The way I ended up creating this effect was to create a div with the image background then have a div container inside that to fill the space with the purple colour using mix-blend multiply. 

### Continued development

Overall I was happy with this build as it is responsive and I didn't notice any issues at different screen sizes. One small issue I noticed is that the border radius isn't working correctly when resizing the window however it works correctly when using chrome dev tools and on mobile.
