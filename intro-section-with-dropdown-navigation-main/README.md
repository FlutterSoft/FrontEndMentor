## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt a lot about navigation menus especially with adding dropdown functionality. 

### Continued development

Going forward I need to code the mobile/desktop navigation as one. I made them two seperate navigation menus as that was the way I knew how to do it but I can't imagine it is optimal.
