## My process

I began by checking the desired design, both desktop and mobile to see how they differed. As they were the same building mobile first wouldn't make much difference here. I then created the html elements before styling with css and making html adjustments. Once that was all working I implemented the Javascript functionality. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned
Going back to vanilla html/css/js after using React for a little while made me appreciate some ease of use with React. Specifically adding buttons and creating click events is much more tiresome with vanilla js.
