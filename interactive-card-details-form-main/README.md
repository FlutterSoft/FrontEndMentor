## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Working with form validation can be tricky, especially needing to show custom error messages for different inputs. I learnt more about using css elements like :not() which I found very useful for form inputs, e.g. :not(:focus)

### Continued development

I need more work with form validation as my code is definitely a bit messy at the moment. I'll work on making validation smoother.
